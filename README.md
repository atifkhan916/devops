To run a Go application using systemd, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a systemd unit file: Create a new file in the /etc/systemd/system directory with
a name ending in .service (e.g. my-go-app.service). This file will define the
systemd service that will run your Go application.
makefileCopy code
[Unit]
Description=My Go application
After=network.target
[Service]
User=yourusername
ExecStart=/path/to/your/go/application
Restart=always
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

2. Modify the ExecStart field: Replace /path/to/your/go/application with the
   full path to the executable file of your Go application. Make sure the file has execute
   permissions.
3. Reload systemd: Run sudo systemctl daemon-reload to reload the systemd
   configuration.
4. Start the service: Run sudo systemctl start my-go-app.service to start the
   service.
5. Check the status of the service: Run sudo systemctl status my-go-app.service
   to check the status of the service. You should see output indicating that the service is running.
6. Enable the service: Run sudo systemctl enable my-go-app.service to enable
  the service so that it starts automatically at boot time.
  That's it! Your Go application is now running as a systemd service. You can stop the service by
  running sudo systemctl stop my-go-app.service, and you can disable it by running
  sudo systemctl disable my-go-app.service.
